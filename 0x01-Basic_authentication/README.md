In this project, you will learn what the authentication process means and implement a Basic Authentication on a simple API.

In the industry, you should not implement your own Basic authentication system and use a module or framework that doing it for you (like in Python-Flask: [Flask-HTTPAuth](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/rpsPy0M3_FJuCLGNPUbmvg)).
